Dear class,

Yifan Qu from the Graduate student support center has reported back
that a lot of people in C++ class are confused on certain specific
issues.  This is great feedback, and while I would be happy if you individually emailed me questions, this is a great way to assess what information people are missing.

So first of all, thanks Yifan for a great job first week.

Now, let's make sure that everyone reads up to learn the missing facts.

Everyone should have mastered integer computation.  The basic 5 operators are +, -, *, /, %
We also worked heavily with floating point (float, double, long double) and there the basic operations are +,-,*,/
(no mod for floating point)
We covered char (one letter) and bool (true/false), but fairly quickly.

Please review my quick reference guide at least through page 50.  I have just edited and added some missing information under loops.

Here is what people seem to be missing.

Comparison operators:
< <= > >= == !=

logical operators

bool x = a < b && a << c; // two ampersands means a<b AND a<c
bool y = a < b || a < c;  // two vertical bars means a<c OR a<c

NOT uses the exclamation point.  For example

ifstream f("hw1a.dat");
if (!f.eof()) {  // if f is NOT at end of file, do something

}

We went through statements very quickly.
Please make sure you can handle while loops, for loops, do..while, if statements,

breaking out of loops with break, and skipping iterations with continue.
